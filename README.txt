Entityconnect expands the entity reference auto-complete field
by adding a add new content and edit current content button.

The "add a new button" will allowed a new entity to be added
via an add form and then return the user to the original form.

The edit button will take the user to the edit form of the referenced entity,
and return them when they are done editing.

Original concept and piece of code based on NodeConnect.

List of working entities on node form:
  - Node / Content type
  - User
