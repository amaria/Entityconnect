Entityconnect expands the entity reference auto-complete field by adding a add new content and edit current content button.

The add a new button will all a new entity to be added via an add form and then return the user to the original form.

The edit button will take the user to the edit form of the referenced entity, and return them when they are done editing.

Original concept based on NodeConnect.
